The script is missing several closing brackets and a button closing tag. Here's the fixed version with the missing characters added:

1. Missing `>` in the button tag (around line 595):
```javascript
                  className="modern-button text-white px-6 py-2 rounded-lg transition-all duration-200"
                >
```

2. Missing closing `)}` for the orders.length === 0 condition (around line 597):
```javascript
              </div>
            )}
```

3. Missing closing `)}` for the component (at the very end):
```javascript
};

export default StudentDashboard;
```

The fixed version includes these missing characters while keeping all other content exactly the same. The closing brackets help properly terminate the conditional statement and the component definition.
